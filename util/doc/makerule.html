    -?                    Dump usage help then exit ( -help also works)
    -I    &lt;directory&gt;     adds a directory to MAKERULE's include path
    -ix                   clear's (empties) MAKERULE's include path
    -p    &lt;env variable&gt;  Adds the contents of an environment variable
                          to MAKERULE's include path.  For example, when using
                          Microsoft compilers, the INCLUDE environment
                          variable contains the include path used by the
                          compiler.  Just use the -p switch to use it.
    -v                    Turns on the verbose flag. Turn verbose mode on
                          enabled on all kinds of messages.  Just try it.
                          Also, turning on the vebose flag turns the
                          quiet flag off.
    -v-                   Turns verbose mode off
    -q                    Enables quiet mode.  When being quiet, MAKERULE
                          only prints errors to STDERR.  Turning quiet mode
                          on implies that the verbose mode is turned off
    -q-                   Turns the quiet mode off
    -a                    Enables the processing of '#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;'
                          include statements.  Normaly, MAKERULE ignores
                          'angle' include statements.
    -a-                   Turns off processing angle-bracket include statments
    -cq                   Places double quotes around obj or exe output files.
    -cq-                  Disables quoting.
    -co &lt;obj output&gt;      Enables generation of object file output statememts
                          in the rule generation. Used for compilers that do not support
                          $* directives. The obj output string is used to identify the output.
                          It is usually -o, but for VC++ it is -Fo. If using VC++ from gnu make,
                          the quoted string option should also be enabled -q.
    -cox                  Disables generation of object file output statements.
    -ce &lt;exe output&gt;      Enables generation of executable file output statememts
                          in the rule generation. Used for compilers that do not support
                          $* directives. The obj output string is used to identify the output.
                          It is usually -o. If using VC++ from gnu make,
                          the quoted string option should also be enabled -q.
    -cex                  Disables generation of executable file output statements.
    -r &lt;recipe&gt;           Sets the recipe to be placed after each rule.
                          NOTE: the recipe will have the dependant file appended, so
                          $* extensions are not needed.
    -rx                   Clears the current recipe.
    -tr &lt;recipe&gt;          Sets the recipe to be placed after each target rule.
                          NOTE: the recipe will have the dependant file appended, so
                          $^ extensions are not needed.
    -trx                  Clears the current target recipe.
    -ta &lt;dependancy)       Adds additional dependancy to target. For example,
                          $(THOBJS) so that harness is built with benchmark.
    -tax                  clears the additional dependancy targets.
    -ta &lt;dependancy)      Adds additional dependancy to the end of the
                          target.  For example, $(THOBJS) so that harness is built with
                          benchmark.
    -tax                  clears the additional dependancy targets.
    -te &lt;library)         Adds additional dependancy library to the end of the
                          target rule.  For example, $(THLIB) so that harness is linked as
                          a library, with $(THOBJS) as a dependancy list.
    -tex                  clears the additional dependancy library.
    -b &lt;extension&gt;        Sets the file extension of the target file
                          in the generated rules.  For example '-b .obj'
                          or '-b .o'.  The default is '.obj'
    -tb &lt;extension&gt;       Sets the file extension of the target executable file
                          in the generated rules.  For example '-tb .exe'
                          or '-tb .lib'.  The default is ''.
    -o &lt;directory&gt;        Sets the target directory used to generate each
                          rule.  For example, on NT systems it is common
                          to put objects in a 'debug' or 'release'
                          subdirectory.  Using '-o debug' cause targets such
                          as 'debug/foo.obj : foo.c' to be generated.  The
                          default is an empty string.
    -ox                   Clears the current target directory
    -to &lt;directory&gt;       Sets the target executable directory used to generate each
                          rule.  For example, it is common
                          to put executables in a bin directory
                          Using '-to bin' cause targets such
                          as 'bin/foos.exe : foos.o' to be generated.  The
                          default is an empty string.
    -tox                  Clears the current target executable directory
    -g &lt;file name&gt;        Ignore the specified include, or source file.  If 
                          MAKERULE see's this file, it will be ignored.
                          You can have as many -g switches as you like.
                          MAKERULE keeps a list of files to ignore.
    -g- &lt;file name&gt;       Remove the file name from the ignore list
    -gx                   Clear the entire ignore file list
    -j &lt;regular expression&gt; Ignore the specified incldue file. If MAKERULE
                          see's this include file, it will be ignored.
                          You can have as many -j switches as you like.
                          MAKERULE keeps a list of include files to ignore
    -j- &lt;regular expression&gt; Remove the regular expression from the ignore list
    -jx                   Clear the entire ignore regular expression file list.
    -w  &lt;directory&gt;       Ignore the specified include directory.  MAKERULE
                          will NOT search this directory for include files.
                          You can have as many -w switches as you like.
                          MAKERULE keeps a list of directories to ignore
    -w- &lt;directory&gt;       Removes the directory from the ignore list.
    -wx                   Clears the ignore directories list.
    -m &lt;number&gt;           Sets the right hand margin.  This defaults to
                          80 but you can set it is small as 60 (which is
                          the minimum).
    -s                    Turns the STRICT flag on.  When STRICT is set, then
                          MAKERULE exits with an error if it can't find
                          an include file, or if a directory on the
                          include path does not exist.
    -s-                   Turns strict mode OFF.
    -t                    Sets the current target.  If there is a current
                          target, then all object file's are associated with
                          only that target
    -t-                   Clears the current target
    -tx                   Clears the target list
    -td                   Dumps the object file list for the current target
                          and clears the current target.
    -tdx                  Dumps the object file list for the current target
                          and clears the ALL targets. (used to handle duplicate
                          target names in the harness).
    -tf &lt;filename&gt;        Dumps the current target to the specified file.
    -tfx                  Resets the output file name to STDOUT.
    -cmd &lt;cmdfile&gt;        Gets more command line arguments from the 'cmdfile'
                          Command files can be nested</PRE>
<PRE>
    -debug                Turns on DEBUG mode.  This also turns on verbose
                          mode.  If you have problems figuring out what
                          MAKERULE is doing, then turn on the debug mode.
                          You may wan't to redirect stderr to a file so you
                          can read all of it.  Under the korn shell this is
                          done like this 'makerule 2&gt; err &gt;makerule.dep'
                          The rules go to the file 'makerule.dep' and all the
                          output to STDERR goes to the file 'err'.</PRE>

<P>MAKERULE automagically generates dependancy rules for C, C++ and
assembly language files using #include.  These rules can then be
included in a make file.</P>
<P>MAKERULE needs to basic pieces of information:</P>
<PRE>
   #1 A list of source files to scan
   #2 A list of include directories in which to look for
      include files.</PRE>
<P>Given this simple information, MAKERULE will generate rules like this:</P>
<PRE>
    obj/app.obj : ../xvutil/assert.h ../platform/am186/DEF186.H                    \
                  ../platform/am186/in186.h ../platform/am186/tmr186.h             \
                  ../platform/am186/am186leds.h ../platform/am186/am186ser.h       \
                  ../platform/pio.h ../common/compiler.h                           \
                  ../platform/am186/printf.h ../common/stdinc.h                    \
                  C:/MSVC/INCLUDE/stddef.h ../platform/am186/ptypes.h              \
                  ../common/serialx.h ../common/serial.H C:/MSVC/INCLUDE/stdarg.h  \
                  ../common/printfe.h
    obj/app.obj : ../app/app.c
            $(COM) ../app/app.c</PRE>

<P>MAKERULE generates human readable output which can be directly included
in a make file.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="using makerule">Using MAKERULE</A></H2>
<P>Makerule generates makerules for object files and executable targets. 
Multiple targets are supported.  The normal operation is to define a
target, and a set of source files.  At the end of each target, the
object files processed will be placed in a make variable, and an
execuaable line built.</P>
<P>At the end of processing, a list of the generated targets will be
placed in a target rule (target:: t1...tn).</P>
<P>MAKERULE must be run from the same directory that you run your make
file.  This is because MAKERULE puts full or relative path names in its
output.  If you don't run them from the same directory, then make won't
look in the right places.</P>
<P>#2 Makerule is controlled by command line arguments and switches.  All
'unswitched' arguments are taken to be either directories or file
names.  They can contain wild cards.  For example '*.c' or '*.cpp'.</P>
<P>Switches that require arguments may be followed by a space such as</P>
<PRE>
    -I c:\msvc\include</PRE>
<P>or, you can stick the together like this:</P>
<PRE>
    -Ic:\msvc\include.</PRE>
<P>Both the above examples add the 'c:\msvc\include' directory to MAKERULE's
include path.</P>
<P>Note that all command line arguments are <EM>NOT</EM> case sensitive.  I hate
case sentitive command line switches.  So '-I' and '-i' are handled the
same way.</P>
<P>A simple makerule execution might look like this:</P>
<PRE>
    makerule -I c:\msvc\include *.c &gt; deps.mak</PRE>
<P>This simple command will generate a set of rules for all the C files
in the current directory.  Note that the output goes to STDOUT which,
in this case, is redirected to the file 'deps.mak'.</P>
<P>The key thing to remember about MAKERULE is that it processes the command
line in order from left to right.  So, put -I switches before file specs.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="important notes">Important Notes</A></H2>
<P>By default MAKERULE makes a best effort at findign all the include file
dependanices.  However, there are a few things you should know.</P>
<P>#1  By default, MAKERULE ignores #include &lt;....&gt; statements.  MAKERULE
    assumes that angle-bracket includes are only used for libraries such
    as the standard library, or other libraries.  e.g. they are used
    for code that you will NOT be changing during development.</P>
<PRE>
    However, not all folks use angle-bracket includes this way.  So, if you
    want to have MAKERULE search for include files specified using
    angle-bracket includes, then use the '-a' switch.  Note that you can
    turn this back off using the '-a-' switch.</PRE>
<P>#2  By default, MAKERULE keeps going if it can't find an include file.  So,
    if you have an #include ``foo.h'' and 'foo.h' cannot be found in the
    source file's directory or in the include path, then MAKERULE just skips
    this file and goes on.  E.g. it is not incldued as a dependancy in the
    rule for the source file which tried ot include it.</P>
<PRE>
    This could happen for several reasons, most likely it will be an
    legitimate include path issue.  For example, you might want to use the
    '-a' switch to process angle-bracket include statements but you don't
    want to include stuff from your compiler's standard library.  So you
    will leave the compilers incldue directory (like 'C:\MSVC\INCLUDE' )
    out of the include path MAKERULE uses to generate its rules.  This is
    a perfectly fine thing to do.</PRE>
<PRE>
    BUT! If you want to makes sure MAKERULE doesn't miss anything then
    turn on STRICT mode by using the '-s' switch.  WHen the stricit mode
    is set, then MAKERULE will exit with an error if it can't find a
    specified directory, source file or include file.</PRE>
<P>#3  Sometimes you <EM>want</EM> MAKERULE to ignore header files, even if you
    have strict mode enabled.  The -g switch does this.  '-g &lt;fn&gt;' adds
    a file name to a list of files to ignore. '-g- &lt;fn&gt;' removes a file
    name from the ignore list.  '-gx' clears the entire ignore file list.</P>
<P>#3  Sometimes you <EM>want</EM> MAKERULE to ignore certain directories in
    the include path.  For example, a setup shell script (or batch file)
    may setup an INCLUDE environment variable.  You would like to use it,
    but there is one directory in the compiler's path that you don't want
    to search.  The -w switch does this.  This switch can also be used
    to ignore directories that do not exist, thus by-passing the strict
    mode check for that include directory.  '-w &lt;dn&gt;' adds a directory
    to a list of include directories to ignore. '-w- &lt;dn&gt;' removes directory
    name from the ignore list.  '-wx' clears the entire ignore directory list.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="command files">Command Files</A></H2>
<P>What would a utility be if it couldn't be run from a command file??? Of course
MAKERULE can read command line arguments from a command file.  Just put a
@&lt;filename&gt; on the makerule command line. There can be more than one and
command files can be nested.  There is no limit to the nesting level.</P>
<P>By convention, I name command files using a '.cml' extension.  MAKERULE
doesn't care though.</P>
<P>Command files can also contain comments.  These are comments just like in
a makfile.  Everything between a '#' and the end of the line is a comment.</P>
<P>Here is an example MAKERULE command file:</P>
<PRE>
      # MAKERULE Command File
      #
      # This entire file is tokenized and logically inserted into the command
      # line where the @ character is</PRE>
<PRE>
      -a             # include #include &lt;...&gt; statements
      -o obj/        # targets go in the obj directory</PRE>
<PRE>
      # use this include directories.
      #
      -I C:/rogue/workspaces/WINNT4/MSVC50/8s
      -I c:/coding/am186tpl/common
      -I c:/coding/am186tpl/xvkernel</PRE>
<PRE>
      -P INCLUDE       # also include the INCLUDE path in the environment</PRE>
<PRE>
      -r &quot;$(COM)&quot;      # C files are built with this recipe</PRE>
<PRE>
      source\*.c       # build all the files in the source directory</PRE>
<PRE>
      -ix              # clear the include path
      -i source        # asm files don't need a fancy include path
      -r &quot;$(ASM) &quot;     # use this recipe to build ASM files
      source/*.asm     # build all the ASM files MAKERULE can find</PRE>

<P>March, 2002:	Rick Foos.
After reviewing makedeps, gcc -M, and autoconf the dependancy generation
was not adequate for the range of tool chains to be supported.</P>
<P>Makerule was enhanced to perform this function.</P>
<P>August, 1998:</P>
<P>I wrote MAKERULE to help me maintain make files.  I like GUI development
environments like Microsoft's Visual C++ and Borland's (now Inprise) C++.
I use them almost every day.  They keep track of the header files (and
other files) which each C or C++ file includes.</P>
<P>However, I do a lot of embedded systems programming.  These tools and
projects are often best built using a make file executed from the command
line.  I just got sick to death of maintaining rules like:</P>
<PRE>
   tcpip.obj : tcpip.c tcpip.h udp.h arp.h</PRE>
<P>So, there you have it.</P>
